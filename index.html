                <p>
                    Unknown to many families, Life Insurance is one of the most
                    effective ways to protect your loved ones and their future. The
                    truth is,
                    <strong>a great policy could easily pay off a mortgage, cover funeral
                        costs</strong>
                    and safeguard your loved ones from inheriting your debts. But with
                    all of these great benefits,
                    <strong>many people may think that the costs are high.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The great news is that in today's market, policies are actually
                    very inexpensive when you know where to look and it’s possible to
                    get up to £100,000 cover from only £10 per month<sup>*</sup>.
